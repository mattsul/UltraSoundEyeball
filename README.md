# UltraSoundEyeball
Predicting the diameters of an eye socket from ultrasound images using Convolutional Neural Networks -- specifically the Network-in-Network design style to estimate both horizontal and vertical diameters. Unfortunately, the data is too large to upload to GitHub. [You can find my Google Colab notebook here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GN5mMpj-aNt6bqga8gBbUNy1RQe9hhvw/view?usp=sharing).
